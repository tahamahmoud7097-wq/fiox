Fiox, a blazingly fast, streaming-first file handler.

• It supports JSON, TOML, CSV, and NDJSON.
• Formats are detected automatically based on file extension.
• Streams files instead of loading them into memory all at once.
• Supports file conversions and file validation.
• if there are any bugs or features you want, open an issue at [`https://github.com/tahamahmoud7097-wq/fiox`].
